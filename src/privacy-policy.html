            after downloading the application by completing the forms available in the "NEW ACCOUNT" section interface.

            Company (through its agents, administrators, and employees) is absolved of any liability or compensation
            (direct or indirect) of any kind and nature, known or unknown, suspected or not, disclosed or not, arising

          <p class="pt-5" data-localize="text-5">1. Evaluation by Individual Users<br />
            Individual users, as drivers, have the opportunity to evaluate the transport companies that have employed
            them through the application. In this regard, the questions that employees answer are:<br />
            - To what extent were you satisfied with the working conditions provided by the transport company, including
            the condition of the vehicles and related equipment?<br />
            - How do you rate the company's reliability in terms of paying drivers according to the agreement?<br />

            schedule?<br />

            2. Evaluation by Legal Entity Users Regarding the Services Provided<br />
            On the other hand, transport companies have the opportunity to evaluate the drivers employed through the
            application. In this context, the questions that companies answer are:<br />
            - How do you evaluate the driver's level of experience and technical skills in the field of road
            transport?<br />
            - To what extent are you satisfied with the driver, considering the absence of major incidents such as theft
            (goods, fuel, etc.), truck abandonment, illegal trafficking, or accidents that could have affected the
            collaboration with the company?<br />
            - To what extent are you satisfied with the driver's collaboration with dispatchers and adherence to the
            work schedule?<br />

            RESPONSIBILITIES AND LIABILITY FOR SERVICE EVALUATIONS<br />

            are drivers or companies. The evaluations reflect the personal opinion and experience of the users and do
            not imply any commitment or guarantee from the Company regarding the truthfulness or accuracy of the
            information provided.<br />

            Additionally, the Company cannot be held responsible for any disputes or litigation that may arise between
            drivers and companies as a result of the evaluations posted on the platform. Any dispute or litigation
            between Users is their exclusive responsibility, and the Company is absolved of any liability or
            compensation (direct or indirect) of any kind and nature, known or unknown, suspected or not, disclosed or
            not, arising in any way related to disputes.<br />

            In conclusion, by using the Tirminator application, Users fully assume responsibility for the content of the
            posted evaluations and for any consequences that may arise as a result of these evaluations. Logistic Mango
